# Dynamic_Programming-_Stickler_thief_pushpa

# Question
Pushpa, a professional thief, wanted to steal coconuts from forest.In the forest the coconut trees
are in a straight line. Each tree has a certain number of coconuts, the only constraint is that if
you rob from the adjacent coconut trees, an alert will be sent to the forest officials who will arrest
Pushpa. Write a program to find the maximum number of coconuts pushpa can steal without
getting caught.

# Example1

list = [2,7,9,3,1]

output = 12

because he can rob from coconut tree 0, tree 2 tree 4 and
none of these trees are adjacent. So the output will be 2+ 9+ 1 = 12
